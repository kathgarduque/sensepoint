     <h3>
     Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to hemoglobic animals (both invertebrate and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 ppm, although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone.
     <br><br>
     Carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom, connected by a triple bond that consists of two covalent bonds as well as one dative covalent bond.[5] It is the simplest oxocarbon and is isoelectronic with the cyanide anion, the nitrosonium cation and molecular nitrogen. In coordination complexes the carbon monoxide ligand is called carbonyl.

     <hr>
     <h3>
        Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries.[Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, but highly toxic. It combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin, which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Concentrations as low as 667 ppm may cause up to 50% of the body's hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin. A level of 50% carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure, coma, and fatality. In the United States, the OSHA limits long-term workplace exposure levels above 50 ppm.

     <hr>
     <h3>
     Carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).
    <br><br>
     Large CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.

     <hr>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       1. CO is actually colorless, tasteless, AND odorless. 
     </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       2. CO is slightly lighter than air.
    </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       3. CO poisoning is the most common type of fatal indoor air poisoning in countries where cooking and heating is still dominated by fires. More than 500 Americans die each year from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.
     </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       4. CO bonds to hemoglobin (Hb), and instead of carrying oxygen (O2) the hemoglobin is then occupied with CO – creating carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO). CO poisoning is actually the result of the head and heart not receiving sufficient oxygen… or asphyxiation.
     </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       5. Installing a CO alarm is a low-cost way of significantly reducing your risk of CO poisoning.
