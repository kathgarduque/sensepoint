     <hr>
     <h3>
       Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With a standard atomic weight of circa 1.008, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass.
       <br><br>
       At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2.
       Hydrogen gas (dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen) is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4% and 75% by volume.

     <hr>
     <h3>
       Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety, from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form.[126] In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement,leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.

     <hr>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       1. Hydrogen is an essential element of our world. In fact, hydrogen makes up about 75% of the mass of the universe. It is found in the sun and most stars.
     </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       2. Hydrogen is the simplest and lightest element on the periodic table of elements.
      </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       3. Hydrogen gas is always bonded to itself or something else to fill its outer shell. That is why hydrogen gas is represented as H2.
     </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       4. The technology to prevent methane and toxic air pollution is widely and easily available and affordable.
     </h3><br>
     <h3 style="text-align:center;">
       5. Hydrogen is highly flammable but will not ignite unless an oxidizer (air) and ignition source are present.
